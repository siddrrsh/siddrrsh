### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year student in CS + Econ/Math at Stanford! I'm interested in AI research and am currently pursuing NLP research at SAIL. I also enjoy working at the intersection of healthcare and computer science and am fortunate enough to work with Dr. Daniel Rubin on such projects. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, cooking, and hiking. You can reach me at sidshr 'at' stanford.edu
